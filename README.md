### TreasureHunt

#### What Code Were You Given? What Code Did You Create Yourself?

In the Treasure Hunt project, I was provided with several key components, including a Jupyter notebook and Python scripts for the `TreasureMaze` and `GameExperience` classes. These components defined the maze environment and the experience replay mechanism, respectively. I was also given the structure of the deep Q-learning algorithm. My primary task was to implement the missing parts of the deep Q-learning algorithm, specifically the training loop, the epsilon-greedy policy, and the neural network training using the provided framework. This involved writing the code for exploration and exploitation strategies, storing experiences, and updating the Q-values through backpropagation.

#### What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists are problem solvers who design, develop, and analyze algorithms and software to solve complex issues. They work on a wide range of applications, from developing efficient data processing techniques and creating secure communication protocols to designing user-friendly software and advancing artificial intelligence. The work of computer scientists matters because it drives innovation and efficiency across all sectors, enhancing productivity, enabling new technologies, and solving critical problems in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Their contributions lead to the development of tools and systems that improve our quality of life and push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.

#### How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem typically involves several structured steps. First, I clearly define the problem and understand its requirements and constraints. This involves thorough research and sometimes consultation with stakeholders. Next, I break down the problem into smaller, manageable components and develop a strategy or algorithm to address each part. I often use a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experimentation to devise solutions. Once a preliminary solution is in place, I implement and test it, iterating on the design based on feedback and performance results. Throughout the process, I use debugging, optimization, and validation techniques to ensure the solution is robust and efficient.

#### What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?

As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to the end user include ensuring that the software and systems I develop are reliable, secure, and user-friendly. I must protect user data privacy and maintain transparency about how their data is used. Additionally, I should strive to make my solutions accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. To the organization, my responsibilities include producing high-quality, maintainable code that aligns with the organization's goals and ethical standards. I must also be honest about the capabilities and limitations of my solutions, avoid conflicts of interest, and contribute to a positive, collaborative work environment. Upholding these ethical standards helps build trust and fosters a positive impact through technology.
